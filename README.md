## Description
 The Attendance Automation project is aimed at automating attendance processes in educational institutions and organizations using OpenCV and Python. This system uses computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to recognize faces in real-time and automatically mark attendance.  The project involves building a facial image database for recognition purposes. OpenCV is used to capture and process images from the camera, while Python is used to implement the logic for face detection, recognition, and attendance marking.  Administrators can view and manage attendance records through a user-friendly interface, which includes generating reports and sending notifications to absent students or employees. Benefits of the system include reducing the time and effort needed for manual attendance tracking, eliminating errors in recording attendance, and improving accuracy and efficiency. The project has the potential to scale up for use in larger institutions and organizations.
